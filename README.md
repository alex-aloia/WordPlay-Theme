WordPlay-Theme
==============

Wordpress base theme to go along with my Ansible Playbooks. Based on Roots with some notable improvements...

Including:
- Replace Grunt with Gulp ( much faster! )
- Use BrowserSync in place of LiveReload
- Composer integrated into the base environment, rather than the theme
- More soon!

*** NOTE: "Roots" theme has changed its name to "Sage" and adopted some of these features (gulp & browser sync), but now uses SASS (lame!).
